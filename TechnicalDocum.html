        <h2>What is Java?</h2>
        <p>Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.
          It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of today’s digital world, by providing
          the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built.
          New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.

          While most modern Java applications combine the Java runtime and application together,
          there are still many applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have a
          desktop Java installed. Java.com, this website, is intended for consumers who may still require Java
          for their desktop applications specifically applications targeting Java 8. Developers as well
          as users that would like to learn Java programming should visit the dev.
          java website instead and business users should visit oracle.com/java for more information.</p>

        <p>Let Us Now Look At the program: </p>
        <p>public class HelloWorldApp { <br>
          public static void main(String[] args){ <br>
          system.outprintin("Hello World")} <br>
          }
        </p>
        <p>Java is Object Oriented Programming <br>
          The main pillars of Object Oriented Programming Language are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Inheritance</li>
          <li>Polymorphism</li>
          <li>Abstraction</li>
          <li>Encapsulation</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="inheritance">
        <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        <p>Inheritance is a mechanism in C++ where an object of a class can
          inherit properties and behaviors from its parent class. Inheritance in Java is a concept that acquires the
          properties from one class to other classes; for example, the relationship between father and son. Inheritance
          in Java is a process of acquiring all the behaviours of a parent object The concept of inheritance in Java is
          that new classes can be constructed on top of older ones. You can use the parent class’s methods and
          properties when you inherit from an existing class. You can also add additional fields and methods to your
          existing class.
          The parent-child relationship, also known as the IS-A relationship, is represented by inheritance.</p>
        <h4>Mode of Inheritance :</h4>
        <p><b>Public Mode : </b> If we derive a sub class from a public base class. Then the public member of the base
          class will become public in the derived class and protected members of the base class will become protected in
          derived class. Protected mode: If we derive a sub class from a Protected base class. </p>
        <p><b>Protected Mode : </b>If we derive a sub class from a Protected base class. Then both public member and
          protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class.</p>
        <p><b>Private Mode : </b>If we derive a sub class from a Private base class. Then both public member and
          protected members of the base class will become Private in derived class.</p>
        <p>The below table summarizes the above three modes and shows the access specifier of the members of base class
          in the sub class when derived in public, protected and private modes:</p>

        <h4>Types of Inheritance in Java : </h4>
        <p><b>Single Inheritance : </b>It occurs when a subclass extends a superclass, resulting in a single chain of
          inheritance.</p>
        <p><b>Multiple Inheritance : </b>It occurs when a subclass extends multiple superclasses, but Java doesn't
          support this type of inheritance due to the Diamond Problem.</p>
        <p><b>Multi-Level Inheritance : </b>It occurs when a subclass extends a subclass, which in turn extends a
          superclass.</p>
        <p><b>Hieratical Inheritance : </b>It occurs when multiple subclasses extend a single superclass.</p>
        <p><b>Hybrid Inheritance : </b>It is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. Java doesn't support
          this type of inheritance directly, but it can be achieved using interfaces.</p>

      <section id="polymorphism">
        <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
        <p>Polymorphism is a concept in C++ that allows objects of different classes to be used
          interchangeably.Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects
          of different classes to be treated as objects of the same class. Polymorphism is often described as "one
          interface, multiple implementations."

          In Java, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows a
          subclass to provide a different implementation of a method defined in its superclass. Method overloading
          allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters.

          By using polymorphism, you can write code that is more flexible and adaptable to change. It also makes it
          easier to maintain and extend your code, since you can modify the behavior of an object without affecting the
          code that uses it.
        </p>
        <h4>In Java Polymorphism Is Mainly Divided Into Two Types: </h4>
        <p>1.Compile time polymorphism <br>
          2.Runtime polymorphism</p>
        <p>Compile time polymorphism: This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator
          overloading. <br>
          Runtime polymorphism: This type of polymorphismis achieved by Function Overriding.
        </p>

      <section id="abstraction">
        <h2>Abstraction</h2>
        <p>Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves hiding the complexity
          of an object and exposing only the essential features to the client. It is used to represent the essential
          properties and behaviors of an object, without exposing the underlying implementation details. Abstraction is
          achieved through abstract classes and interfaces in Java. An abstract class is a class that cannot be
          instantiated, but can be inherited by other classes. An interface is a blueprint for classes that provides a
          common set of methods that must be implemented by the implementing class. By using abstraction, you can create
          a higher level of abstraction for complex objects, making the objects easier to understand, use, and maintain.
          This also helps to reduce code duplication and improve code modularity and reusability. In short, abstraction
          is used to provide a simplified view of a complex system by hiding the implementation details, and exposing
          only the essential features and behaviors of an object to the client.
        </p>
        <p><b>Abstraction using Classes: </b>An abstraction can be achieved using classes. A class is used to group all
          the data members and member functions into a single unit by using the access specifiers. A class has the
          responsibility to determine which data member is to be visible outside and which is not.</p>
        <p><b>Abstraction in Header Files: </b>An another type of abstraction is header file. For example, pow()
          function available is used to calculate the power of a number without actually knowing which algorithm
          function uses to calculate the power. Thus, we can say that header files hides all the implementation details
          from the user.</p>
        <p><b>Advantages of Data Abstraction: </b> <br>
          1.Helps the User to avoid writing the low level code. <br>
          2.Avoids code duplication and increases reusability. <br>
          3.Can change internal implementation of class independently without affecting the user. <br>
          4.Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.

      <section id="encapsulation">
        <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
        <p>Encapsulation is a technique in C++ that enables the programmer to restrict access to certain data members
          and member functions.Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves
          wrapping an object's data and behavior within a single unit or object, protecting it from outside interference
          or modification. In Java, encapsulation is achieved by using classes and objects.

          A class in Java is a blueprint that defines the properties and behaviors of an object. By using the concepts
          of encapsulation, you can control the visibility of the data within a class, and restrict access to the data
          from outside the class. This is achieved through the use of access modifiers such as "private," "protected,"
          and "public."

          The private access modifier makes a field or method accessible only within the class. The protected access
          modifier makes a field or method accessible within the class and any subclasses. The public access modifier
          makes a field or method accessible from anywhere.

          In addition to access control, you can use methods within a class to access and modify the data within the
          class, creating a layer of abstraction between the data and the client. This allows you to control the data
          and behavior of an object, and to maintain the integrity and consistency of the data. </p>
          <p>
          In short, encapsulation in Java is the technique of wrapping an object's data and behavior within a single
          unit or object, protecting it from outside interference or modification, and allowing for better control and
          maintenance of the data and behavior of an object.</p>
